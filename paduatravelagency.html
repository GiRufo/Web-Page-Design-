		<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Hotel">History </a></h1>
		<p>The Stanley Hotel was frist opened on July 4th, 1909 in Estes Park, Colorado five miles from the entrance of the well-known Rocky Mountain National Park. It was created by <img src="images/fostanley.jpg" alt="Freelan Oscar Stanley">, better know as F.O Stanley, after he became ill with life-threatening tuberculosis. His treatment? To get away with his wife Flora to a place with fresher air, lots of sunlight, and a heartier diet. To achieve this, the Stanley's went to Denver, Colorado in March of 1903, and by June had decided to spend the rest of their summer in Colorado. By the end of the tourist season, F.O's health had improved immensely, and the couple decided to return to Estes Park every year. Since the Stanley family were already well known in their homestate of Maine due to their steam-powered car F.O decided to take the rustic scenery of Colorado into his own hands by making a hotel to cater to the elite wealthy urbanites back home. The land was purchased in 1908 from Lord Dunraven, a man who had been previously using the land as a private hunting preserve. The hotel was opperated by Stanley until he sold it to Roe Emery, an auto and hotel magnate from Denver.</p>
		<br />
		<p>The hotel gained the bulk of its popularity after horror author Stephen King and his wife Tabitha stayed at the Stanley Hotel in 1974. They had booked a room (room 217) during the off season of the hotel, and came to find that they were the only overnight guests. King describes the experience: "...we found ourselves the only guests in the place â€” with all those long, empty corridors." Although the Stanley was never before known to be a scary or haunted hotel, King claims that the night of his stay he dreamt of his young son being chased through the halls by a fire-hose. When he awoke in a sweat, clearly shaken up by this dream, he went to a chair facing the window, stared at the mountains, lit a cigarette, and began to create what would later be known as <i>The Shining.</i></p>
		<h1><a href="https://www.hauntedplacesinamerica.com/the-stanley-hotel">Hauntings</a></h2>
		<p>One of the most commonly spotted ghosts inhabiting the Stanley hotel is that of Mr. F.O Stanley himself. He is usually seen in the Billiard Room and the lobby, his favorite places in the hotel while he was alive. Bartenders have claimed to see F.O Stanley strolling through the bar, but he vanishes once the workers reach the kitchen to try and stop him</p>
		<br />
		<p>Along with Mr. Stanley, Mrs. Flora Stanley is also frequently spotted in the hotel. It is said that she entertains guests by playing the piano in the ballroom, and typically the piano keys are seen moving, but upon further investigation the music ceases and the piano keys stop.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Certain rooms in the hotel are thought be haunted, specifically Room 407. Lord Dunraven is thought to occupy this room and has been seen standing in the corner close to the bathroom door. A witness claimed that he would turn the light on and off, and at times when it was off the witness attempted to make the ghost aware that they knew of his presence. They also said that they were only staying for two nights and asked if the Lord would please turn the light back on. The light then flickered back on. It has also been said that after this incident noises could be heard from an elevator that was out of order at the time, as well as a ghostly face that has been seen on occasion even when the room is vacant.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Another room that has a reputation is Room 418. This room is thought to contain children spirits. Cleaning staff claim to hear odd sounds emitting from the room along with impressions on the bed after no one has been in there. When the room is occupied guests claim to hear children playing in the hallway at night, and there was even a couple who had to leave early in the morning because the noise of childhood merriment was too much for them; there were no children in the hotel at that time.</p>
		<br />
		<p>When the King's stayed at the Stanley Hotel they stayed in Room 217, a room where a tragic accident had occurred in 1911. This accident revolves around Elizabeth Wilson, a housekeeper who nearly died from a gas leak explosion in the room due to the power going out and her entering the room with a candle. She survived, and it is believed that the only reason she lived until the 1950's is because her corset saved her from injury, apart from quite a few broken bones, after falling from the 2nd floor. Since then, guest report the lights turning on and off, doors opening and closing on their own, and their suitcases being unpacked and items being put away, which was customary of housekeepers at the time.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Hotel staff and tour guides like to tell guests a story of a small child that has been seen calling for their nanny, which Steven King claims he saw.</h>
		<h1>The Stanley Hotel Ghost</h1>
		<p>An infamous picture was taken by a ghost tour patron of the hotel one day, and a clear figure of a child can be seen looking out of one of the windows. What makes this photo incredible is that the window was open, but the figure is hazy and blurred.</p>
		<h1>My Experience</h1>
		<p>I went to the Stanley Hotel after its recent conversion from a seasonal hotel to a year round one. We, being my fellow Ghost Investigators, had to call early for reservations due to the hotels popularity, and requested a room on the 4th floor because the staff claims that it is the most haunted. We went with the hope and intention of finding some sort of energy or presence in the Hotel to prove that ghosts are real. Our experiences were less than expected, but enough to prove SOMETHING to a disbeliever. We spent the night in the infamous Room 217, where we were kept up all night by the incessant laughter of children outside of our door. In the morning we decided to explore Estes Park, and so we went into the lobby, asked the bellhop if there were any children on our floor to which he replied that there wasn't, and left the hotel. We purposefully left all of our belongings in our bags with the hopes that Ms. Elizabeth Wilson would reveal herself to us. We were not disappointed. When we arrived back at our room around three we found that all of our stuff was neatly folded and put away in the provided drawers. The room smelled sweeter than when we had left, and I had the definite feeling that we were not alone. Besides that our stay in Colorado was pretty uneventful. The mountain range is breathtakingly beautiful and makes up for the lack of ghostly evidence. Overall, the experience was incredible and I suggest that everybody attempts to make a trip to Estes Park, Colorado at some time in their life. Whether you are a ghost-believer, a ghost-fearer, or somebody who just wants to experience the beautiful Rocky Mountain air,the Stanley Hotel is a great place to stay. It provides all of its guest with an interesting and spooky ghost tour, as well as a historically accurate depiction of the hotel, and a respectful and attentive staff.</p>
