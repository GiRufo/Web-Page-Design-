	<h3>Things About Studying Abroad</h3>
	</header>
	
	<main>
		<p>Student exchange became popular after World War II with the intention to 
		increase the understanding and tolerance of other cultures as well as the youth's 
		language and social skills. The number of students studying over seas only 
		increased after the Cold War.</p>
		<p>Typically, exchange students stay in their "host" country from 6-10 months, but 
		could extend to several years. Many exchange programs offer academic credit.</p>
		<p>The application process could take as little as 4 months before departure to
		10 months in advance. Students must be between the ages of 15 and 18, but some 
		programs allow older students to travel in a specialized-work program.</p>
		<p>Studying abroad helps students from all walks of life to learn more about the 
		world and the types of people that inhabit it. While giving kids the chance to 
		grow and become independant it also gives them the opportunity to learn and 
		experience history and the world as they would never otherwise be able.</p>
